%With the high number of software that nowadays is in commerce, testing has an important role for companies.
%In fact, testing is necessary to evaluate the quality of the software.\\
%However, thanks to the new technologies, other problems can be \emph{translated} into code and tested accordingly.\\
%Specifically, Web-pages testing can be done representing all the executable path through a graph.
%Graph where each node is a state of the application and the transitions are the links, buttons, text-boxes, operations that lead the service from a state to another.\\
%Although now the problem can be solved with known technologies, web-pages can be complicated so a hands-on approach for the test generation is expensive.\\
%Hence, it is required an automatic way to generate tests.\\
%This program is able to solve the problem creating a testsuite for the input application following the random testing approach.\\
%The goal is performed operating on the tested application.
%Firstly an instrumentation phase to insert extra code for the analysis.
%Then, the creation of test-cases for the line-coverage\textbackslash branch-coverage analysis is performed.\\
%The program is based on Java and the instrumentation is for Java classes.\\
Nowadays, a considerably high amount of software is present in the commercial scenario.
For this reason, the testing phase plays a crucial role for the software developing companies.\\
Thanks to new technologies, which are continuously facing those problems, other scenarios
can be explored and tested accordingly using the code (to be modified). More specifically,
the testing phase on web pages can be carried out making use of a graph, where each
depicted node represents a state of the application, transitions correspond to links, buttons,
text boxes or every kind of operation which can lead to a movement from an application state to another.\\
Despite the solution to the illustrated situation can be exploited with other SoA processes,
web pages can be extremely demanding in terms of test generation.\\
In this document, a program able to create a test suite for a given application following a
random testing approach is presented. This program pursues the main goal following these
steps: first, an instrumentation phase is performed in order to insert extra code for analysis
purpose, then test cases for the line-coverage/branch-coverage analysis are created.\\
The illustrated program has been coded using Java language, supporting Java for the representation of the graphs.
