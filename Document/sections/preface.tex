With the high number of software that nowadays is in commerce, testing has an important role for companies.
In fact, testing is necessary to evaluate the quality of the software.\\
However, thanks to the new technologies, other problems can be \emph{translated} into code and tested accordingly.\\
Specifically, Web-pages testing can be done representing all the executable path through a graph.
Graph where each node is a state of the application and the transitions are the links, buttons, text-boxes, operations that lead the service from a state to another.\\
Although now the problem can be solved with known technologies, web-pages can be complicated so a hands-on approach for the test generation is expensive.\\
Hence, it is required an automatic way to generate tests.\\
This program is able to solve the problem creating a testsuite for the input application following the random testing approach.\\
The goal is performed operating on the tested application.
Firstly an instrumentation phase to insert extra code for the analysis.
Then, the creation of test-cases for the line-coverage\textbackslash branch-coverage analysis is performed.\\
The program is based on Java and the instrumentation is for Java classes.\\
